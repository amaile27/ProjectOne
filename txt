// Aja’s Simon Says Game:

// Page loads with 4 circles and a start button.
// Need a board array to represent 4 circles in html.

// Player clicks start button to initiate game.
//    create event listener for player clicking start button
//    invoke initialize game function

// Use arrays to keep track of Computer sequence and Player sequence.

// Each Computer turn - create new round function 
//     have computer randomly click an index from the board array (use Math.random along with Math.floor to get whole number that relates to index from board array).
//     Use DOM to relate on click to which circle in html
//     Add setTimeout to computer sequence when more than 1 click so that all the clicks don’t happen at once.
//     Update computer sequence for each new random click and add to another variable that can be called the new sequence (use .push to add to the array)

// Each Player turn - starts when Computer ends current sequence
//     Use DOM to relate on click to which circle in html again
//     Use new function to check if player can move on to the next round by seeing if Players sequence is equal to Computers new sequence
//     Invoke new round function if players sequence matches computer sequence
//         Return that they can keep playing - use textContent
//     Else if the players sequence does not equal the computers sequence 
//         Return that the player lost - use textContent and refresh game with init game function 
//     Use setTimeout function to display lost game before restarting
